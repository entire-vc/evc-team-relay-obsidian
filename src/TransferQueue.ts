	 * entirely rather than guess -- an undefined base can't distinguish a
	 * genuine unsynced edit from this client's own in-flight seed/upload
	 * racing our read (VaultShare.publishDoc()'s raw
	 * `ydoc.getText("contents").insert()`, which bypasses both TransferQueue
	 * lanes entirely and so is invisible to hasInFlight()) -- confirmed live
	 * against the self-hosted stand: reusing enqueueFetch() for a periodic
