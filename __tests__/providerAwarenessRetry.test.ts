/**
 * Unit tests: YSweetProvider's initial-awareness resend-on-warm-up
 *
 * The bug: on WebSocket open, the provider broadcast its awareness state once
 * immediately, then scheduled exactly ONE retry 2000ms later — a fixed,
 * one-shot guess at how long the relay's room warm-up takes. If that single
 * retry ALSO landed inside the warm-up window, presence never appeared until
 * some unrelated awareness change happened to resend it.
 *
 * Fixed by retrying repeatedly, bounded by `provider.synced` (the closest
 * real signal this protocol has that the room is up — it flips true once the
 * doc's own sync-step2 response arrives) rather than a single fixed delay.
 *
 * `client/provider.ts` has no Document/AuthSession/pocketbase imports, so —
 * unlike most of this repo — it's directly testable: only the WebSocket
 * itself (the true external/network boundary) is faked via the provider's
 * own `WebSocketPolyfill` injection point; everything else (retry scheduling,
 * the synced getter/setter, encoding) is the real code under test.
